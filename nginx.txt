### **How to Activate Your FastAPI Project with Nginx?**
To make your FastAPI project **active** and **accessible via Nginx**, follow these steps:

---

## **1️⃣ Check If Your Nginx is Running**
First, check if Nginx is **already running** on your server:
```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
```
- **If it's active** (green text, running), go to step 2.  
- **If it's inactive**, start it using:
```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx
```
- **Enable Nginx to start on boot:**
```bash
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

---

## **2️⃣ Activate Your Nginx Configuration File**
Your FastAPI project needs a configuration file in **Nginx** to be active.

### **📂 File Location:**
Nginx configurations are stored in:
```bash
/etc/nginx/sites-available/
```
But to **activate a site**, we must create a **symbolic link** in:
```bash
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

### **Check If Your FastAPI Config is Active**
Run this command to list enabled sites:
```bash
ls -l /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```
- If your FastAPI project **is listed**, it's already active.  
- If it's **not listed**, activate it using the next step.

---

## **3️⃣ Enable Your FastAPI Site (Make It Active)**
If your FastAPI config file (e.g., `myfastapi`) is in **`sites-available/`** but NOT in **`sites-enabled/`**, enable it by running:
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/myfastapi /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```
💡 **This makes the configuration active.** It links the file to the enabled directory.

---

## **4️⃣ Test the Nginx Configuration**
Before restarting Nginx, check if the configuration is correct:
```bash
sudo nginx -t
```
- If the output shows **"syntax is OK"**, move to the next step.
- If there's an error, open the file and fix the issue:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/myfastapi
```
Then save and exit (`CTRL + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`).

---

## **5️⃣ Restart Nginx to Apply Changes**
Now restart Nginx to apply the new settings:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

---

## **6️⃣ Verify If Your Site is Running**
Run:
```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
```
If everything is correct, your FastAPI project is **active and accessible**! 🎯

---

## **How to Disable Your FastAPI Project?**
If you want to **disable your FastAPI Nginx config**, remove the symbolic link:
```bash
sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/myfastapi
```
Then restart Nginx:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
Now, your FastAPI project **is disabled** and no longer accessible.

---

### **🚀 Summary**
| Task  | Command |
|--------|---------|
| **Check if Nginx is running** | `sudo systemctl status nginx` |
| **Start Nginx** | `sudo systemctl start nginx` |
| **Enable Nginx on boot** | `sudo systemctl enable nginx` |
| **Enable FastAPI config** | `sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/myfastapi /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` |
| **Check Nginx config** | `sudo nginx -t` |
| **Restart Nginx** | `sudo systemctl restart nginx` |
| **Disable FastAPI site** | `sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/myfastapi` |

Now your FastAPI app is **active and running through Nginx**! 🚀🎯

### **🔒 How to Set Permissions for the Static Folder in Nginx?**  

If Nginx cannot serve static files (CSS, JS, images) and you get **403 Forbidden** or **Permission Denied**, it’s usually due to incorrect folder permissions.  

---

## **🔍 1️⃣ Check Current Permissions**  
Run this command to check permissions:  
```bash
ls -ld /home/ubuntu/fastapi_project/static/
```
If it shows something like:
```
drwx------ 2 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Mar 18 12:00 static
```
It means **only the owner (ubuntu) can access it**, and Nginx is blocked.

---

## **🛠️ 2️⃣ Fix Permissions**  

### **✔ Option 1: Give Read Permission to Everyone**  
```bash
sudo chmod -R 755 /home/ubuntu/fastapi_project/static/
```
📌 **What does this do?**  
- `7 (rwx)`: Owner (read, write, execute)  
- `5 (r-x)`: Group (read, execute)  
- `5 (r-x)`: Others (read, execute)  

---

### **✔ Option 2: Set Correct Ownership (Recommended)**  
Nginx runs as the `www-data` user, so change ownership:  
```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /home/ubuntu/fastapi_project/static/
```
📌 **Why?**  
- `www-data:www-data` makes sure Nginx owns the files and can serve them.

---

### **✔ Option 3: Allow Nginx to Access the Parent Directory**  
If the `static` folder is inside `/home/ubuntu/fastapi_project/`, but Nginx still can't access it, run:
```bash
sudo chmod +x /home/ubuntu
sudo chmod +x /home/ubuntu/fastapi_project
```
📌 **Why?**  
- The `+x` permission lets Nginx **enter the directories** without seeing other files.

---

## **✅ Final Step: Restart Nginx**
```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
Now, your static files should load! 🚀 🎉
